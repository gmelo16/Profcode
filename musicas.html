    I'm findin' ways to articulate the feeling I'm goin' through<br>
    I just can't say I don't love you<br>
    'Cause I love you, yeah<br>
    It's hard for me to communicate the thoughts that I hold<br>
    But tonight I'm gon' let you know<br>
    Let me tell the truth<br>
    Baby, let me tell the truth, yeah<br>
    
    You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes<br>
    You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry<br>
    You're scared to be lonely, 'specially in the night<br>
    I'm scared that I'll miss you, happens every time<br>
    I don't want this feelin', I can't afford love<br>
    I try to find a reason to pull us apart<br>
    It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect<br>
    And I know that you're worth it<br>
    I can't walk away, oh!<br>
    
    Even though we're going through it<br>
    And it makes you feel alone<br>
    Just know that I would die for you<br>
    Baby, I would die for you, yeah<br>
    The distance and the time between us<br>
    It'll never change my mind, 'cause baby<br>
    I would die for you<br>
    Baby, I would die for you, yeah<br>
    
    I'm finding ways to manipulate the feelin' you're goin' through<br>
    But baby girl, I'm not blamin' you<br>
    Just don't blame me, too, yeah<br>
    'Cause I can't take this pain forever<br>
    And you won't find no one that's better<br>
    'Cause I'm right for you, babe<br>
    I think I'm right for you, babe<br>
    
    You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes<br>
    You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry<br>
    It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect<br>
    And I know that you're worth it<br>
    I can't walk away, oh!<br>
    
    Even though we're going through it<br>
    And it makes you feel alone<br>
    Just know that I would die for you<br>
    Baby, I would die for you, yeah<br>
    The distance and the time between us<br>
    It'll never change my mind, 'cause baby<br>
    I would die for you<br>
    Baby, I would die for you, yeah<br>
    
    I would die for you, I would lie for you<br>
    Keep it real with you, I would kill for you, my baby<br>
    I'm just sayin', yeah<br>
    I would die for you, I would lie for you<br>
    Keep it real with you, I would kill for you, my baby<br>
    Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na<br>
    
    Even though we're going through it<br>
    And it makes you feel alone<br>
    Just know that I would die for you<br>
    Baby, I would die for you, yeah<br>
    The distance and the time between us<br>
    It'll never change my mind, 'cause baby<br>
    I would die for you<br>
    Baby, I would die for you, yeah babe<br>
    (Die for you)<br>
